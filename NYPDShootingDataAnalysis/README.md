This project is about NYPC Shooting data analysis. After analyzing the data from both the current data and historical data, we can make few observations.

1. There was a downward trend of the number of shootings each year until 2019 and they rose again in 2020
2. The most number of shooting incidents happen in the summer usually in June, July, August and September months.
3. Most of them happen on during the hours from 2200 to 0040 on Friday leading into Saturday and on Saturday leading into Sunday. So it is safe to say that most of them happen on weekends.
4. Most of the people involved in shooting incidents are Black by race followed by Hispanics.
5. More than 90% of the people involved in shooting incidents are males
6. Most affected people are in the age group of 18 to 44 years. Perpetrators are more likely to shoot people in their own age group.

Recommendations:

1. Additional legislature could be passed to make gun control more effective, stricter screening measures would certainly help.
2. Additional security resources and measurements to tackle and prevent such incidents especially in the boroughs with high incident rate (Bronx and Brooklyn) and between 1200 to 0400 hours in places such as clubs and restaurants that are open late
   in the night.
3. Police department can hire more personnels to take night shifts on weekends during the months of May to August. They can start by focussing on precinct 73 and 75 where the incident rates are highest.
4. Even though causation cannot be outrightly implied, underlying issues like education, low household income, ratio of minimum wage to cost of living, increase in unemployment rates would need to be addressed.
5. Based on the age group of the perpetrators and the predominant gender and race, empowerment programs such as scholarship, mentorship, job creation, higher education awareness, workshops can be targetted towards this specific group.
